# Fire Alarm Sequencer: Virtual Coded Pull Station Module
This module aims to recreate the notion of an old-school, mechanical pull station with code wheels, in the style of an addressable module.

Currently, support for the major codes and various march BPMs are included, but future use cases may include simulating actual various station codes.

Additionally, a virtual "shunt" is provided, which can provide a NC/NO "running" status of the pull station, and both can be tied to "NAC" style inputs.
