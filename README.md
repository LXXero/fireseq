# Fire Alarm Sequencer: Virtual Coded Pull Station Module
This module aims to recreate the notion of an antique mechanical fire pull station with code wheels, in the style of a modern addressable pull station module.

Currently, support for the major codes and various march BPMs are included, but future use cases may include simulating actual various station codes.

Additionally, a virtual "shunt" is provided, which can provide a NC/NO "running" status of the pull station, and both can be tied to "NAC" style inputs.
